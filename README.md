## Create a Property
Go to the 'New' dropdown menu in the navbar. There you will find the page you use to create a property.
## Invite Tenants
Provide the e-mail address of tenants to invite, if they choose to accept, they will receive notifications.
## Create Expenses
Provide a title, amount, frequency and date for the expense, this will now be included in calculations and reports.
## Create Expense Distribution Assignments
Some expenses are not distributed evenly among tenants, expense distribution assignments allow for expenses
to be split semi-manually. For example, one tenant may owe 600 in rent for having the bigger room, while the
total for rent is 2000 split among 4 tenants.
